# ClaytonAI

## Overview
This project serves as my first GitHub repository created during my early development experience. It includes a collection of basic files, folders, and experiments intended to practice Git version control, repository management, and initial Python or scripting concepts.

## Technologies Used
- Git and GitHub
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Python (planned for future additions)

## Project Contents
- `afile.txt`: Example text file for commit testing
- `stuffFolder/`: Placeholder folder created for structure practice
- `.gitignore`: Configuration to ignore unnecessary files
- `README.md`: Repository overview

## Getting Started
This project is primarily for personal development and demonstration purposes. No special installation steps are required.
